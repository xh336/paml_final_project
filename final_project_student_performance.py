st.markdown("Welcome to the Practical Applications in Machine Learning (PAML) Course! You will build a series of end-to-end ML pipelines, working with various data types and formats, and will need to engineer your system to support training, testing, and deploying ML models.")


st.markdown("""The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your programming skills and ability to build a simple application using the Streamlit library. As a machine learning (ML) practitioner, you are expected to have basic knowledge of programming, learning new programming languages, and making things work off-the-fly. You will build a basic user interface that walks users through an end-to-end ML pipeline for a case studies involving fundamental ML algorithms including regression, classification, clustering, and deep learning.

The learning outcomes for this assignment are to end an app using: 
- Text Elements
- Data elements
- Chart Elements
- Input Widgets
- Media Elements
- Layouts and Containers
- State Management

st.markdown("""You will build a web application that helps Machine Learning Practitioners through an end-to-end ML pipeline.

    1. Explore and visualize the data to gain insights.
    2. Preprocess and prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.
    3. Select a model and train it. Fine-tune your model.
    4. Test Model.  Evaluate models using standard metrics.
    5. Deploy your application (present your solution). Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.

st.markdown(""" Future homework assignments will engage students in more an in depth implementation and discussion of ethical implications of four applications.
    
    1. Regression for Predicting Housing Prices
    2. Clustering for Document Retrieval
    3. Classification for Product Recommendation
    4. Deep Learning for Image Search
