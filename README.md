Standardized Testing Score Prediction

This application utilizes Machine Learning Models to create Standardized Testing Score Predictions! With this model, you are able to input demographic information to predict the score for a Standardized Test in math, reading, or writing given to high school students.

Introduction
This project aims to explore the complex factors affecting student academic performance by developing a predictive model based on demographic variables. The significance of this study lies in its potential to enhance educational equity and access by identifying key predictors of academic outcomes. This can help in formulating targeted interventions for students needing additional support. Utilizing machine learning techniques, such as regression and classification, the model will not only handle complex variable interactions but also offer interpretable insights, focusing particularly on demographic influences to reveal subtle but impactful relationships in student performance data.

Instructions
The example dataset is a simulated dataset updated in 2024 on Kaggle. It includes all eight input features of 1,000 sand their standardized test scores (writing, reading, math scores).

The user would input these features:

Gender: Male or Female
Race/Ethnicity: A, B, C or D
Lunch: Free/reduced or Standard
Test preparation course: None or Completed
Parental level of education: Some High School, High School, Some College, Associate's Degree, Bachelor's Degree's, Master's Degree
Math Score: 0 - 100, Reading Score: 0 - 100, Writing Score: 0 - 100
This web application will allow you to:

Explore and visualize the data to gain insights.
Preprocess and prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.
Select a model and train it.
Test Model. Evaluate models using standard metrics.
